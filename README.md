# TwoWindows

This is demonstration of a multi-window prototype for HaxeFlixel showing a substantial memory leak while the second window is open.

This uses flixel, openfl and lime. Versions tested are:

haxelib list
flixel: [4.11.0]
lime: [8.0.0]
openfl: [9.2.0]

But similar code has leaked on the older stack of Flixel dev on Lime 7.9.0, OpenFL 9.1.0.
